BaxShops
=========

BaxShops is a shop plugin for Bukkit, based on SwornShop, updated for Bukkit 1.8

BaxShops adds more features such as:
* /buy, /sell, /restock are now commands
* Shops can have more than one location, allowing them to be accessed in multiple areas of a world
* Items can now be sold directly to the shop's inventory
* Sale requests can be accepted automatically
* Enabling buy requests for a shop allows you to choose who you're selling to
* All items can be removed by the owner of a shop instead of only 2/3
* Shops are saved in human-readable JSON format

Although superficially, the plugin behaves similarly to the original, they are NOT compatable.
