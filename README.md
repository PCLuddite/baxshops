BaxShops
=========

BaxShops is a shop plugin for Bukkit, based on nathan/shops, updated for Bukkit 1.8

<h5>FEATURES</h5>
* /buy, /sell, /restock are now commands
* Shops can have more than one location, allowing them to be accessed in multiple areas of a world
* Items can now be sold directly to the shop's inventory
* Sale requests can be accepted automatically
* Enabling buy requests for a shop allows you to choose who you're selling to
* Shop admins can teleport between shop locations
* All items can be removed by the owner of a shop instead of only 2/3
* Shops are saved in human-readable YAML format

<h5>IMPORTANT</h5>
This plugin is still in the developmental stages! It is for advanced users only. Changes between non-consecutive commits are <b>not</b> guaranteed to be compatible. It is recommended that you create a backup before updating. Consecutive commits will normally have a mechanism for state file conversion which may persist for several commits, but this compatability support may be dropped at any time. Finally, although this plugin behaves similarly to nathan/shops, they are NOT compatable (compatability <i>might</i> be added in the future).
