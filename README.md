BaxShops
=========

BaxShops is a shop plugin for Bukkit, based on SwornShop, updated for Bukkit 1.8

BaxShops adds more features such as:
* /buy, /sell, /restock are now commands
* Multiple shop locations - allows the shop to be accessed in multiple parts of a world
* Sell to shop - now you can sell thigs directly to the shop's inventory
* Auto accept sale requests
* Buy requests - make buyers ask permission to buy
* Remove all inventory in a shop (instead of just 2/3 of what you put in)
* Shops are saved in human-readable JSON format

Although superficially, the plugin behaves similarly to the original, they are NOT compatable.
