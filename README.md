BaxShops
=========

BaxShops is a shop plugin for Bukkit, based on and intended to be the ongoing replacement for [SwornShops](https://github.com/nathan/shops)
which has since been deleted. The original project can still be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180611033644/https://github.com/nathan/shops)

**FEATURES**
* Ability to convert from the old shops.dat file produced by SwornShops
* /buy, /sell, /restock are now commands
* Shops can have more than one location, allowing them to be accessed in multiple areas of a world
* Items can now be sold directly to the shop's inventory
* Sale requests can be accepted automatically
* Enabling buy requests for a shop allows you to choose who you're selling to
* Shop admins can teleport between shop locations
* All items can be removed by the owner of a shop instead of only 2/3
* Shops are saved in human-readable YAML format

**IMPORTANT**
This plugin is still in beta! It is recommended to back up your saved data before updating.
